# Medicare-Analysis

This dataset contains a provider-level summary of inpatient discharges, average charges, and average Medicare payments for the top 100 Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs). The Medicare_Analysis notebook answers the following questions.

1. Which types of DRGs ("DRG.Definition") account for most of the patient population across all facilities?
2. For each facility ("Provider.Name"), which DRGs form the largest portion of the patient population?
3. Calculate the average Medicare payments per DRG per facility.
4. Is there a way to group facilities in a logical way?
